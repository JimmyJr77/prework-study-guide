# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This study guide was created to support a baseline of understanding of development, to instill a tiny bit of confidence, and to support course review in the form of a study guide. It addresses the traditional problems associated with starting a new period of instruction. Students have a variety of backgrounds and knowledge. Students have varying schedules and expectations. This course helps establish a baseline such that everyone comes to the course with a foundation and the instructor knows what foundation they must start from. Specifically, I learned that there are some similarities between Python, the only language I know, and the languages taught in the pre-work. I also learned that there are also a lot of differences.

To use this Prework Study Guide, simply review the notes provided for each of the section, as desired. If you need suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. You can also review or manipulate code within the index, js script or readme file to aid in recall.
